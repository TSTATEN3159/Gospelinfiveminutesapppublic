## Architecture Notes

### How Apple Pay Works in This App

1. **Platform Detection**: App detects iOS using Capacitor
2. **Payment Flow**:
   - User selects amount ‚Üí taps "Donate"
   - App checks Apple Pay availability
   - Backend creates Stripe PaymentIntent
   - Apple Pay sheet presented with payment summary
   - User authorizes with Face ID/Touch ID
   - Stripe processes payment
   - App receives success/failure event
   - Donation recorded in database

### Code Structure

- **Frontend**: `client/src/pages/DonationPage.tsx`
  - Imports `@capacitor-community/stripe` for Apple Pay
  - Uses `StripeCapacitor.createApplePay()` for iOS
  - Falls back to web Stripe for web/Android

- **Backend**: `server/routes.ts`
  - `/api/create-payment-intent` - Creates Stripe PaymentIntent
  - `/api/stripe-webhook` - Verifies and records donations
  - `/api/verify-payment` - Manual payment verification

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for Stripe
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_xxx  # Frontend Stripe key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx       # Backend Stripe key

# Optional for custom merchant ID
VITE_APPLE_MERCHANT_ID=merchant.com.thegospelin5minutes
```
